# EnDecon

## Introduction

EnDecon is an R package developed to deconvolute spatial transcriptome (ST) data. EnDecon is an ensemble learing model by intergrating top-performing methods (i.e., cell2location, RCTD, and spatialDWLS) using linear weighted model. EnDecon provides an alternative and more effective method for ST deconvolution. EnDecon can benchmark different deconvolution methods by calculating the root-mean-square error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), and Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between the predicted cell type compositions and the known compositions.
